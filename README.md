## Welcome to the TrixMC Documentation

**Here, you can find information about the different gamemodes on TrixMC.**

TrixMC is a fast, modern Minecraft Network that provides a high class gameplay experience. We are community-centered and do what the players want.

### Here is a list of our current gamemodes:

- [SkyBlock (Season 5)](SkyBlock/ "SkyBlock") - A close-to-home SkyBlock experience but with teaming, banking and challenges.
  
- [Derpitcraft (Season 9)](Derpitcraft/ "Derpitcraft") - Our flagship gamemode, the best vanilla-like SMP with advanced moderation, tight discord integration, a robust teaming system and much more to provide the best experience possible.
  
- [Bedwars](Bedwars/ "Bedwars") - The most popular Minecraft minigame in the world including fast paced PvP action, strategy and teamwork.

**We also have a Discord Server where we announce updates, and interact with the community. Our server is also tightly integrated with Derpitcraft, our Hermitcraft-like vanilla friendly SMP, with a custom Discord bot called The Oracle.**
